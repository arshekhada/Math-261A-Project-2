## Project folder structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **Analysis/** – Contains the main R analysis script (`Project2.R`) that prepares the data, runs the regression models, and generates the tables and figures used in the report.

- **Data/** – Contains only the data-cleaning script (`clean_tablea.R`).  
  The raw and cleaned datasets used in the analysis are **not included** in this GitHub repository because the dataset’s license does not permit redistribution.

- **Paper/** – Contains all materials used to prepare the final written report:
  - `paper 2.qmd` – Quarto source file for the report  
  - `paper-2.pdf` – Rendered PDF submission  
  - `four_panel.png` – Figure included in the analysis  
  - `references.bib` – Bibliography file for citations  
  - `regression_results_table.csv` – Regression results exported for inclusion in the paper  


## Data

The data for this project comes from the [California Open Data Portal](https://data.ca.gov/), specifically the [Housing Element Annual Progress Report – APR Data by Jurisdiction and Year dataset](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/housing-element-annual-progress-report-apr-data-by-jurisdiction-and-year), which provides multi-year city-level housing approvals and related economic indicators for California cities.


## External Resources

The final report and code were written by Abhishek Rasikbhai Shekhada. However, the following external resources were used for preliminary research and support:

- ChatGPT used for brainstorm wording, clarify questions about R/Quarto syntax, review draft code structure and make sure the citation appears right next to the relevant statement. I made sure that all final code and text reflect my own understanding and work.
